      <h2 id="community-title">At Ghorbety, we felt the homesickness before it even started</h2>
      <p id="community-p1">We understand what it’s like for a student to leave home and step into a new world all alone</p>
      <p id="community-p2">That’s why we decided to build the first smart app in Egypt dedicated to truly supporting university students living away from home</p>

      <p id="community-p3">Ghorbety isn’t just an app</p>
      <p id="community-p4">It’s a space that brings students everything they need to live, study, and grow</p>
      <p id="community-p5">From safe and affordable student housing</p>
      <p id="community-p6">To reliable academic resources</p>
      <p id="community-p7">To real training opportunities that open doors to careers</p>
      <p id="community-p8">To everyday services that make life easier</p>

      <p id="community-p9">But what makes Ghorbety special is the student community it creates</p>
      <p id="community-p10">Where people talk</p>
      <p id="community-p11">Support each other</p>
      <p id="community-p12">And feel like they truly belong</p>

      <p id="community-p13">We believe that being away from home doesn’t have to feel lonely</p>
      <p id="community-p14">When you’re surrounded by people who understand, support, and share the same journey</p>

      <p id="community-p15">Ghorbety is not just a service</p>
      <p id="community-p16">Ghorbety is a community</p>

      <p id="community-p17">Because being far from home is easier</p>
      <p id="community-p18">When we’re together</p>
